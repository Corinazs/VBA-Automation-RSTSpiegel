This is an example of processes that I have automated. Here, SAP is first accessed and the user specifies which reporting period 
they want to export. The programme first opens SAP and asks the user to log in. Here, the usage and access rights are ensured, 
which are especially important for external audits. Everything else is done automatically: the report is exported, the data is 
inserted into the sheet and updated. Then a pivot table updates itself and maps only selected accounts into the table. 
Further calculations are made to show the changes in the development of provisions within the year.
